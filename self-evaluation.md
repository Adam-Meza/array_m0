# Self Evaluation

## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

So far I feel good about them. I think I understand the basic principles of what's currently expected. I think I'm struggling with syntax. For example I haven't memorized when to use () or {} or []. I also think I'm improving my ability to learn remotely on my own. I understand that this is the most crucial component of this assignment. 

## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I think I wanna learn more about the syntax of conditionals in Javascript. 

## What questions do you have about Arrays? 

I have questions about how to call on multiple arrays at once. I want to learn how to make more dynamic conditionals utilizing arrays.
